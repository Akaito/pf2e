Locks of higher qualities might require multiple successes to unlock, since otherwise even an unskilled burglar could easily crack the lock by attempting the check until they rolled a natural 20. If you lack the proper tools, the GM might let you used improvised picks, which are treated as shoddy tools, depending on the specifics of the lock. <br><br><strong>Critical Success</strong> You unlock the lock, or you achieve two successes toward opening a complex lock. You leave no trace of your tampering.<br><strong>Success</strong> You open the lock, or you achieve one success toward opening a complex lock.<br><strong>Critical Failure</strong> You break your tools. Fixing them requires using Crafting to Repair them or else swapping in replacement picks (costing 3 sp, or 3 gp for infiltrator thieves’ tools).&nbsp;</p>"
