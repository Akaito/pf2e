You can spend a single action (this action has the concentrate trait) to determine if any magical auras are present in the area. This has the effects of a 1st-level @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.gpzpAAAJ1Lza2JVl]{Detect Magic}&nbsp;spell but isn't magical. By straining, you can also discover the source of the magic and its school (with the effect of a 4th-level <em>detect magic</em> spell), but doing so prevents you from using this ability again until you've rested for 8 hours.&nbsp;</p>"
