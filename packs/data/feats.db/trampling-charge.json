You command your mount to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Bcxarzksqt9ezrs6]{Stride} up to its Speed (or to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.H6v1VgowHaKHnVlG]{Burrow}, @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.pprgrYQ1QnIDGZiy]{Climb}, @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.cS9nfDRGD83bNU1p]{Fly}, or @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.c8TGiZ48ygoSPofx]{Swim}, if it has the corresponding movement type), moving through the spaces of any foes in your path up to one size smaller than your mount.</p>\n<p>Your mount deals damage equal to the melee Strike using its legs to each creature whose space you move through, subject to a basic Reflex save against your mountâ€™s Athletics DC. On a critical failure, the creature also becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Flat-Footed} until the end of your next turn. You can damage a given creature only once during this movement.</p>"
